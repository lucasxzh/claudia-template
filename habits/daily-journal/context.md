# Habit Context: Daily Journal

## Why
To spend time more intentionally, track progress, and record daily notes. To give an overall "fulfillment score" out of 5.

## Rules of Engagement
- **Goal:** Record notes about every single day.
- **Metric:** Overall "fulfillment score" out of 5.
  - **3/5:** Baseline successful day. Did what I needed to do.
  - **4/5:** A day I'd *want* to remember.
  - **5/5:** A day I *will* remember.
- **Structure:** Entries are stored in the `entries/` directory, organized by month (`entries/YYYY-MM/YYYY-MM-DD.md`).
- **Context Continuity (CRITICAL):** Before writing a new journal entry, read the past 7 journal entries to maintain narrative context for quality feedback. You should also consider past monthly reflections if that habit exists.

## Interaction Protocols (Agent Instructions)
1. **New Entry:**
   - Ask guiding questions until the user is explicitly done.
   - Core questions: "How was your day today?", "What went well?", "What didn't go well?".
2. **Cross-Habit Updates:**
   - Check `habits/dashboard.md` to understand what other habits the user is working on.
   - If the user mentions an update about another habit, update that habit's context, journal, and tracker accordingly.
3. **Formatting**
   - The overall fulfillment score should belong at the top.
   - When given a narrative about the day, record that narrative in its original format. You can correct simple typos/errors.
   - You can add other information like highlights, lowlights after the narrative.
4. **Coaching Output (MANDATORY)**
   - **Trigger:** AFTER you have successfully logged the entry and synced the dashboard.
   - **Action:** You MUST end your response with a dedicated section (e.g. "## Insights").
   - **Tone:** Observational but piercing. Be exacting with praise/validation.
   - **GOAL:** Act as a mirror that reveals blind spots. Analyze the entry for cognitive dissonance.
   - **Items of consideration:**
     - **Pattern Recognition:** Treat this entry as the latest chapter in a running novel. Connect today's "plot points" to the broader themes from the last 7 entries.
     - **Score Audit:** Do you agree with the user's score based on the narrative?
     - **Challenging Questions:** Do you see any gaps between the user's beliefs and their reality?
